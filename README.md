More info:

This plugin was design to work out of the box with any theme by adding a class to 
#	the menu container and then manipulating the HTML tag w/ said class by way of JS
#	
#
#	Plugins tested to work with this theme work a tad bit differently.  Instead of 
#	adding a class it uses custom js files that have the main navigational selectors 
#	already defined.  JS manipulates the menus by using the already defined tags. 
#
#	This plugin has been tested on a growing number of themes including:
#   twentytwelve, twentyeleven, responsive, wp-foundation, required-foundation
