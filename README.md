More info:

This plugin was designed to work out of the box with a large number of popular themes if not all
	the menu container and then manipulating the HTML tag w/ said class by way of JS
	

Plugins tested to work with this theme work a tad bit differently.  Instead of 
	adding a class it uses custom js files that have the main navigational selectors 
	already defined.  JS manipulates the menus by using the already defined tags. 

This plugin has been tested on a growing number of themes including: (will, in most cases, work on themes other than the following as well)
   twentythirteen, twentytwelve, twentyeleven, responsive, wp-foundation, required-foundation, neuro, Swtor_NeozOne_Wp, lowermedia_one_page_theme, expound, customizr, sixteen, destro, swift basic, Isabelle, spacious

   *Some CSS edits may be required
